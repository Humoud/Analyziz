# Analyziz ðŸ”¬
https://analyziz.online

A web app inspired by [CyberChef](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef) which aims to make the work of infosec analysts easier.

If you answer yes to one or more of the below then this tool is suitable for you:

- Hate defanging/refanging ðŸ¦· urls and domains by hand? âœ…
    - Does looking up the domain on Urlscan, DomainTools, Google sound good? âœ…
- Calculate hashes of samples then look them up on VT *without submitting the sample there*? âœ…
- How about getting everything you are working on in plain text? âœ…
- Does achieving the above via a web browser sound convenient? âœ…



Features:
- Calculate MD5, SHA1, SHA256 hashes for files.
    - Lookup hashes on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
- Defang and Refang URLs.
    - Lookup domains on:
        - [Urlscan.io](http://urlscan.io/)
        - Whois via [DomainTools](https://www.domaintools.com/)
        - Google search (using site operator) [Google](https://google.com)
- Present the hashes, defanged/refanged domains, and urls in text format for easy copy/pasta.

-----

**Note:** The tool only does look ups when using VirusTotal and Urlscan. <u>No submissions are made and no data is collected by the tool.</u>
